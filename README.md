Wasp is a domain specific language for building full-stack web apps with ease. This
project was created for the [Wasp Hackathon #2](https://hackathon.wasp-lang.dev).

To learn more about hexagons, check out [Red Blob Games](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/implementation.html) extraordinary tutorial on them. This game wouldn't exist (at least not with hexagons) if it weren't for this website.
